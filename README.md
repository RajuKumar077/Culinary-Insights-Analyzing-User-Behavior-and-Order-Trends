### Project Name: **Culinary Insights: Analyzing User Behavior and Order Trends**

### Summary of the Project

The project titled **Culinary Insights: Analyzing User Behavior and Order Trends** aims to explore and analyze datasets related to user behavior, cooking preferences, and order trends for upliance.ai's AI cooking assistant. The assignment involves several key tasks that encompass data cleaning, merging, analysis, visualization, and reporting. Below is a detailed overview of the project's components:

1. **Data Preparation**:
   - **Datasets**: The project utilizes three datasets: `UserDetails`, `CookingSessions`, and `OrderDetails`.
   - **Data Cleaning**: Initial steps involve checking for missing values and duplicates across the datasets. Appropriate methods are employed to handle missing data, such as filling in with mode values or dropping duplicates to ensure data integrity.

2. **Data Merging**:
   - The cleaned datasets are merged to create a comprehensive DataFrame that links user details with their cooking sessions and order information. This integration allows for a holistic view of user interactions with the cooking assistant.

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - The project includes various analyses to uncover insights into user behavior and preferences:
     - **User Demographics**: Analyzing age distribution and other demographic factors influencing cooking preferences.
     - **Cooking Preferences**: Identifying popular dishes among users based on order data.
     - **Order Trends**: Examining how order amounts change over time to identify trends in user engagement.

4. **Data Visualization**:
   - Visualizations are created using libraries such as Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly to represent findings clearly. Key visualizations include:
     - Histograms for age distribution.
     - Bar charts for popular dishes.
     - Line charts showing order trends over time.
     - Pie charts illustrating meal type distribution.

5. **Insights and Recommendations**:
   - The analysis culminates in a report summarizing key insights derived from the data. Recommendations may include strategies for enhancing user engagement, optimizing menu offerings based on popular dishes, and leveraging demographic insights for targeted marketing.

6. **Documentation and Submission**:
   - The entire project is organized in a GitHub repository containing all relevant files, including scripts for data processing, visualizations, and the final report in a README.md file. This structure ensures clarity and ease of access for reviewers.

### Conclusion

This project not only aims to fulfill the assignment requirements but also provides valuable insights that can help upliance.ai refine its offerings and better serve its target audience. By leveraging data analytics, the company can enhance its AI cooking assistant's capabilities, ultimately driving user satisfaction and engagement.
